# Random number generator
Same as repository for hw2, generate 1000 random number and visualize it. But this is for hw4, which will be implement on virtual environment and Binder.

## Virtual environment creation
###Step 1: create a blank virtual environment and name it dsci560H4
- `pip install virtualenv` to install package of virtual environment
- `py -m venv dsci560H4` to create a virtual environment called dsci560H4
- `.\dsci560H4\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment for implement scripts.
